# Alt-Q
# - On the main prompt: Push aside your current command line, so you can type a
#   new one. The old command line is re-inserted when you press Alt-G or
#   automatically on the next command line.
# - On the continuation prompt: Move all entered lines to the main prompt, so
#   you can edit the previous lines.
bindkey '^[q' push-line-or-edit

# Alt-H: Get help on your current command.

  unalias $1 2> /dev/null   # Remove the default.

  # Load the more advanced version.
  # -R resolves the function immediately, so we can access the source dir.
  autoload -RUz $1

  # Load $functions_source, an associative array (a.k.a. dictionary, hash table
  # or map) that maps each function to its source file.
  zmodload -F zsh/parameter p:functions_source

  # Lazy-load all the run-help-* helper functions from the same dir.
  autoload -Uz $functions_source[$1]-*~*.zwc  # Exclude .zwc files.
} run-help

# Alt-V: Show the next key combo's terminal code and state what it does.
